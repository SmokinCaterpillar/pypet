# Ok, now we want to make our own (derived) parameter that stores source code of python functions.
# We do NOT want a parameter that stores an executable function. This would complicate
# the problem a lot. If you have something like that in mind, you might wanna take a look
# at the marshal (http://docs.python.org/2/library/marshal) module
# or dill (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill) package.
# Our intention here is to define a parameter that we later on use as a derived parameter
# to simply keep track of the source code we use ('git' would be, of course, the better solution
# but this is just an illustrative example)

    # We need to override the `f_set` function and simply extract the the source code if our

    # For more complicate parameters you might consider implementing:
    # `f_supports` (we do not need it since we convert the data to stuff the parameter already
    #    supports, and that is strings!)
    #
    # and
    # the private functions
    #
    # `_values_of_same_type` (to tell whether data is similar, i.e. of two data items agree in their
    #   type, this is important to only allow exploration within the same dimension.
    #   For instance, a parameter that stores integers, should only explore integers etc.)
    #
    # and
    #
    # `_equal_values` (to tell if two data items are equal. This is important for merging if you
    #       want to erase duplicate parameter points. The trajectory needs to know when a
    #       parameter space point was visited before.)
    #
    # and
    #
    # `_store` (to be able to turn complex data into basic types understood by the storage service)
    #
    # and
    #
    # `_load` (to be able to recover your complex data form the basic types understood by the storage
    # service)
    #
    # But for now we will rely on the parent functions and hope for the best!
